      <li>
        Successfully advocated for the use of <a href="https://www.pyrocms.com/">PyroCMS</a> on several of our microsites to allow hoteliers a friendly and easy interface to update their sites. The decision to use PyroCMS was based on our needs for a CMS that was not only extremely lightweight and easy to use, but was quick and easy to theme for.
      </li>
      <li>
        Completely redesigned and redeveloped the company&#8217;s booking engine, offered to hoteliers for use on their own websites, and drastically improved UX resulting in increased conversion across many existing sites.

      </li>
      <li>
        Introduced the use of the <a href="http://www.lesscss.org/">LESS CSS preprocessor</a> which decreased development time and enabled us to keep third-party libraries and code up-to-date with great ease.
      </li>
      <li>

    <p>
      I was contracted by the studio to establish their online presence with a website. The website was initially raw HTML with PHP used to create includes for the header and footer and was my first foray into PHP. I have since rewritten the code and implemented PyroCMS for the backend to allow the client to update the site as they see fit.
    </p>

    <p>
      Relationship with the client has steadily grown and recurring work with them has included the design of business cards and large-scale advertising banners.

    <p>
      Promethean Gaming is an Irish website focused on the Gaming scene in Ireland and this project was initially established to make it easy to introduce myself to Wordpress while also keeping my interest held so that I would be constantly updating it. I am currently in the process of developing my own custom Wordpress theme for this site.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since launching the site, I have also established a dedicated Minecraft server running on a VPS. The server is in private beta at the moment and runs a custom version of Minecraft (<a href="http://www.technicpack.net/">Tekkit/Technic</a>) and currently has whitelist enabled. If you&#8217;d like to help us test, <a href="mailto:hello@coog.ie">drop me an email</a>!

      Gazebo <small class="muted">2013</small>
    </h1>
    <p>
      Gazebo is an open-source application for managing Dungeons &amp; Dragons groups, currently in planning stages. The purpose of the app is to familiarise myself with JavaScript MV* stacks such as <a href="http://emberjs.com/">Ember</a>, <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">Backbone</a>, or <a href="http://angularjs.org/">Angular</a>. At the moment, I&#8217;m leaning more towards Angular. <small class="muted">HAH! Leaning! Angular! No&#8230;?</small>
    </p>

    <p>
      The app will allow the tracking of members of the group, shared information between group members, individual encounters, and eventually track in-depth data such as damage per player, per encounter.

  <h1 class="beta indent">Education</h1>

  <p>
    I&#8217;m largely self-taught when it comes to front-end web development and have acquired these skills over the past few years by following blogs and tutorials by some of the most respected individuals in the industry such as <a href="//.paulirish.com/">Paul Irish</a>, <a href="//css-tricks.com/">Chris Coyier</a>, <a href="//davidwalsh.name/">David Walsh</a>, and <a href="//csswizardry.com/">Harry Roberts</a> - to name but a few.
  </p>

  <p>That being said, I have recently finished the following course:</p>

      <li>Completed course with First Class Honours.</li>
      <li>Was elected class representative. During my tyranny, I encouraged fellow classmates to collaborate and share course notes with each other via Github repositories - inspired by the theory of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_intelligence">Collective Intelligence</a>.</li>

  <p>
    There are a lot of things that I enjoy, but out of all of them, I enjoy these the most: reading about the latest advancements in web technologies &amp; reading in general, typography, music, fixing things most people would deem broken, playing games &ndash; board &amp; video, and taking myself seriously at times.
